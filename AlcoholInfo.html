                <h1 class="text-center">Fun and drinking.</h1>
                <p>There are many ways to go out and have fun. You can do it with friends, lovers, both and so much more. The activities you can do are also almost endless, you can go bowling, dance, go out to eat, just have fun, so on and so forth. However, there is one thing which can always be added to any of these; alcohol!</p>
                <p>Alcohol is for some people a must when they go out, but would it be that bad if they tried to out one night without drinking, or setting a limit to how much they can drink?</p>
                <h1 class="text-center">So what happens when you drink?</h1>
                <p>Alcohol affects you, both your movements, thoughts, mood and personality. One night with drinking increases the chance of things going wrong more than one with moderatet drinking to no drinking.</p>
                <p>When drinking some people get mood swings, which can result in your friends not really recognizing you, and in the worst case it can create problems in your freindships. Mood swings can also cause you to pick fights with strangers, insult family or try dangerous stunts with friends, depending on what kind of moodswing you get. However, these moodswings can also be positive as some people become happy and energetic as well as unrestrained which can make a night out better for some. This can also come to bite you though if you become <i>too</i> unrestrained and end up doing things which are embarrassing or straight up dangerous and/or illegal.</p>
                <p>It's no problem to have a night out without drinking being in focus and still have fun, and the chance for things going wrong is much less that way too. So think twice about how much you need in one sitting and take good care of yourself and those around you!</p>

                <h1 class="text-center">What is alcohol?</h1>
                <p>The most socially-accepted addictive drug worldwide.</p>
                <h1 class="text-center">But what exactly <i>is</i> alcohol?</h1>
                <p>Ethanol is what we usually refer to as "Alcohol" in alcoholic beverages. It's a psychoactive substance, which means that your mental processes will be affected by it when you consume it. </p>
                <h1 class="text-center">Where does it come from?</h1>
                <p>Ethanol, or ethyl alcohol, is produced by fermenting sugar or yeast, or through petrochemical processes.</p>
                <h1 class="text-center">Why do we make alcohol?</h1>
                <p>You most commonly probably know that we use alcohol as a recreational drug, meaning we consume it in order to alter our state of mind for a more pleasurable experience. Of course, not everyone finds it pleasurable to be in that kind of state.</p>
                <p>Another use for alcohol is for medical purposes. Alcohol has amazing disinfecting properties, meaning that hospitals and clinics will have a healthy supply in store. However, that alcohol is not for drinking, because whereas an usual beer has around 4% alcohol, the spirits you'll find in a hospital has around 70%. You'd fall dead before you got drunk off of that!</p>
                <p>Ethanol is also widely used in scientific chemical testing, or synthesis of organic compounds.</p>
                <p>Ethanol is also used as a clean fuel source!</p>
                <h1 class="text-center">How does it work in recreation?</h1>
                <p>When consumed, Ethanol works as a central nervous system depressant. This means that all transmitions throughout you central nervous system are weakened. Essentially your brain activity will be slowed, and you'll behave very strangely because your brain will suddenly not be able to keep up with a lot of things. Some of the symptoms of taking alcohol, or any central nervous system depressants can be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Slurred speech</li>  
                    <li>Poor concentration</li>  
                    <li>Confusion</li>  
                    <li>Headache</li>  
                    <li>Light-headedness</li>  
                    <li>Dizziness</li>  
                    <li>Dry mouth</li>  
                    <li>Problems with movement and memory</li>  
                    <li>Lowered blood pressure</li>  
                    <li>Slowed breathing</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Because of some of these symptoms, a person can be quite dangerous to themselves and others, especially when operating heavy machinery, like cars. You can find out more about drunk driving under the "Driving" category on this page.</p>
                <p>An accident while under the influence of alcohol is worse than without. Alcohol thins your blood, lowering your blood pressure. This means that you will bleed faster than normal, and because you'll already be light-headed and have trouble breathing, an accident can be very serious in that scenario.</p>
                <h1 class="text-center">What other effects does alcohol have?</h1>
                <p>Because of the way alcohol works with other chemicals, whenever you consume it you'll affect the synthesis, releasing, and signalling of different kinds of neurotransmitters like serotonin, glutamate, GABA, endocannabinoids and their receptors. This can have some unpredictable effects, especially if you are on other kinds of drugs that affect these neurotransmitters, like anti-depressants.</p>
                <p>Abuse of alcohol also affects the functionality of things like the gastrointestinal tract, your liver, and pancreas. Extended abuse can permanently harm these organs, cripling you. It also affects your body's effectivity in metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fat, and leads to a decrease in immune systems responses to infections, ironically enough.</p>

            <div class="hideLead">
                <h1 class="text-center">Why not drink and drive? What could possibly happen?</h1>
                <p>A lot, actually.</p>
                <p>Not only can you be fined and your license revoked for several years if you get caught, you can also end up killing others, and most likely yourself. Most drunk driving accident deaths include the driver of the car. This is because there is a much bigger chance of hitting things such as trees, houses, street lights or more rather than hitting another peson walking along the street.</p>
                <h1 class="text-center">You mentioned fines and my license getting revoked, it can't possibly be that much!</h1>
                <p>Fines and other consequences of driving and drinking as well as when these are given, heavily depend on the country you live in. For the sake of giving an example this site will be loking at the country of Denmark for it.</p>
                <p>In Denmark, the limit of how much blood alcohol content (BAC) you're allowed to have when driving is 0.05%. Everything above this will be fined or more, so let's take a look at what can happen.</p>
                <h2 class="text-center">First time getting caught.</h2>
                <p>When you're caught the first time and have a BAC of 0.051% to 0.12% you will get a fine which is calculated with this formula:</p>
                <p class="text-center">Monthly pay (after taxes) * BAC = fine</p>
                <p>You will also be on trail for a period of time where your lisence will be taken from you if you get caught for anything else, such as speeding. If you instead have a BAC of 0.12% then your license will also be suspended in at least 3 years. If you have a BAC of 0.2% your fine will be your entire monthly pay (after taxes), your license will be suspended and you will have a 20 day prison sentence.</p>
                <h2 class="text-center">Second time getting caught or more.</h2>
                <p>From here, the fine you get will be your monthly pay (after taxes) regardless of how much your BAC is. Your license will also be suspended for at least 3 years or more depending on how much over 0.05% your BAC is and how many times you've been caught before and and a prison sentence of at least 10 days is likewise given.</p>
                <h1 class="text-center">Okay, but i won't get caught.</h1>
                <p>Even if you won't you still pose a big risk to those around you as well as yourself. As we explain further in the slide about the body, your bodies functions lesson and become slower, so even if you think you can drive a car, you most likely cannot. It would be better to have another means of transportation home other than driving yourself if you've been drinking.</p>
                <h1 class="text-center">Fine, but i definitely drive the morning after, right?</h1>
                <p>That actually depends on how much you had the night before and how long it has been since then! As we also explain further in the slide about the body, the time it takes your body to lover your BAC is not affected by sleep or any other tips you may find or hear of, it is constant. So even if it is the next day, you might still have a BAC higher than the allowed 0.05%, so plan your drinking carefully when you need to drive even the next day!</p>
